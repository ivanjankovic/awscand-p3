## Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

- IAM policy is not restrictive, allowing full administrative access.
- Loadbalancer does not redirect HTTP to HTTPS requests.
- there's no IAM password policy
- there's direct access from the public internet to the application listening on port 5000
- logging is not enabled for the S3 buckets

## Recommendations to remediate the vulnerabilities.

- set IAM policy to readonly
- enable MFA for root access
-  have a stricter IAM password policy
- limit traffic on the Loadbalancer
- disable unnecessary port access to the EC2 instance
- enable logging for S3 buckets
- traffic should only be allowed from security groups
