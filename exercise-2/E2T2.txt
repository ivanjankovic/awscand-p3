Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

1.) IAM policy is not following the principle of least privilege, allowing full access to resources.
2.) Loadbalancer is not configured to redirect Non-SSL(HTTP) requests to SSL(HTTPS)
3.) Application running on port 5000 can be easily accessible directly from public internet. 
4.) Serverside encryption and Logging is not enabled for S3 buckets
5.) IAM password policy - minimum length - Root account is not complaint 
6.) EC2 instance should be managed by AWS Systems Manager.



**Bonus** - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
--------------
-- IAM:
---- More Strictier/stringent password policy. Prevent reusing of previous passwords.
---- Update Root account password to meet the PAssword policy.
---- Update IAM policy to readonly 
-- Limit traffic on loadbalancer 

-- EC2 Intances:
---- Allow traffic only from Security Groups 
---- Disable unnecessary port access to the EC2 instance.
---- configure instance to be managed through AWS Systems Manager.

-- Storage:
---- S3 buckets- Enable logging

## Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

The IAM policy is not restrictive, allowing full administrative access.
The Loadbalancer does not redirect HTTP to HTTPS requests.
There's no IAM password policy
There's direct access from the public internet to the application listening on port 5000
Logging is not enabled for the S3 buckets

## Recommendations to remediate the vulnerabilities.

Set IAM policy to readonly.
Enable MFA for root access.
Have a stricter IAM password policy.
Limit traffic on the Loadbalancer.
Disable unnecessary port access to the EC2 instance.
Enable logging for S3 buckets.
Traffic should only be allowed from security groups.

AttackInstanceSG:
- 4.1 Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22

WebAppSG:
- 4.1 Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22
- 4.2 Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 3389

default:
- 4.3 Ensure the default security group of every VPC restricts all traffic

Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.

4.1: Modify the inbound rule for each security group to allow ingress from restricted IPs (in this case my IP) or delete the rule allowing ingress on port 22.

4.2: Modify the inbound rule for each security group to allow ingress from restricted IPs (in this case my IP) or delete the rule allowing ingress on port 3389.

4.3: Delete all inbound and outbound rules from the default security group. Add the required rules to other security groups attached to the vpc.

#1.  securityhub-restricted-ssh-6650deb4 -- EC2 SecurityGroup -- Checks whether the incoming SSH traffic for the security groups is accessible. The rule is compliant when the IP addresses of the incoming SSH traffic in the security groups are restricted.

#2. ecurityhub-iam-user-no-policies-check-a9111220 -- IAM User -- Checks that none of your IAM users have policies attached. IAM users must inherit permissions from IAM groups or roles.

#3. securityhub-restricted-rdp-4acfcf5c -- EC2 SecurityGroup -- Checks whether the incoming RDP traffic is Allowed from 0.0.0.0/0. This rule is compliant when incoming RDP traffic is restricted.


Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
#1.  Access to the EC2 SecurityGroups have to modified to control access to the instances.

#2.  All Users must be added to group and then only the groups should be granted access to AWS roles

#3. Access to certain TCP ports should be restricted.
