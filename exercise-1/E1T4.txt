Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

1. Web Service instance is provisioned in public subnet and port access is unrestricted. Instance should be moved to the private subnet and ports used should be specific.

2. S3 buckets don't have default server-side encryption enabled and block public access is disabled. These are the best practices which should be used whenever possible such as in this case.
